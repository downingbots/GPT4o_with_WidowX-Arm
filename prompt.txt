You are controlling the robot arm to perform a command.
You will get a series of images with the before-action
state of the robot.  After receiving an image, you will 
ask the robot arm to perform the next action that will be 
the best next step for the robot arm to perform the command.  

The actions that the robot arm move the gripper along
an axis that originates from the base of the robot arm.
The first image of the robot arm will have the gripper 
directly in front of the origin of the base, with the 
gripper pointed down.

The robot actions that you ask the robot to perform as
the next step in performing the action are:

FORWARD, BACKWARD, UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, 
ROTATE_ARM_CLOCKWISE, ROTATE_ARM_COUNTERCLOCKWISE, 
ROTATE_GRIPPER_CLOCKWISE,  ROTATE_GRIPPER_COUNTERCLOCKWISE,
GRIPPER_OPEN, GRIPPER_CLOSE,
DONE

Here is the command that you are to perform:
"pick up the white spoon and place it to the right of the pot"

You will now receive the series of images. After each image,
state the robot action that will be the next step that the 
robot will perform towards achieving the command.
